# eGFRMDRD
The Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) is a measure used to assess kidney function. It estimates the rate at which kidneys filter waste from the blood. The eGFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.
In this code, we define the calculate_egfr function that takes age, gender, serum creatinine level, and race as parameters. It validates the input values, follows appropriate guidelines for gender and race, and calculates the eGFR using the MDRD equation.

The example usage prompts the user to enter the required information, calls the calculate_egfr function, and prints the calculated eGFR value. It handles exceptions if there are any validation errors.

Additionally, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate interpretation of eGFR results and appropriate medical guidance.
